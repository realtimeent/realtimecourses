        <h2>syntax.</h2>
        <p>in programming syntax is the most vital
            aspect regardless of which language you are using,for example
            in python as we are to see further you will find out that
            a function named clicked and prints out a statement in the console or terminal is 
            written as below.
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="code-cont">
        <div class="func-cont">
            
                def Clicked:
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("you clicked here")

            
           
        </div>
        <div class="jav-cont">
            <p>and in javascript language this is equivalent to.<br>
                function Clicked() { <br>
                   console.log("you clicked here")
                };
            </p>
        </div>
        

    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <p>For now if you dont understand what the above two functions mean, then dont
            worry more clear explanations ahead in this topic coming. we are getting a brief 
            introduction to what we call <strong>syntax</strong>.
            The systematic way of how a statement should be written in any programming 
                laguage is refffered to as syntax.
            
        </p>
        <p>For a linear equation X + 1 = 6 and a quadratic equation x2 - 1 = 0,the way
            of writting out the above two equations can be refffered to as syntax in simple
            terms
